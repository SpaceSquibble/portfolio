    <h2>Live Coding</h2>
    <div id="dark">
    <p> Live coding really helped me learn how to teach. By better understanding how to teach others, I can more effectively teach myself. I also learned just how different the same language can be which prompted me to understand the code more thoroughly so that I could reproduce it in different versions of the same language (processing, p5.js, khan academy). It also helped me strengthen my understanding of object-oriented code. I can now confidently make and manipulate objects. </p>

      <p>The hackathon taught me how to work with a team on a project from scratch. Most programing in school is done individually while in the real world, programming is often done in groups. I learned just how important version control is, especially the bigger your group or project gets. This module also helped strengthen my HTML skills and I was able to use my resources (khan academy, freecodecamp, etc) to solve the problems I was facing.</p>

    <p>Intro to javascript taught me the basics of javascript. In addition to that it served as a good refresher for the basics of coding that we learned in grade 10 and 11. It also made me realize how art can help get people interested in learning to code. As an artist myself, I may try using code to produce artwork in the future.</p>

    <p>Intro to HTML/CSS taught me how to build a website from scratch. This module introduced us to many resources, such as github. I plan on using this portfolio I have made, and expanding on it. I'll have to furthur my knowledge of HTML/CSS of I wish to do so.</p>

    <p>Natural Simulation taught me a lot of complicated programming concepts in simpler terms. After doing this module, I feel more confident in trying harder programming related things. Taking difficult concepts and breaking them into smaller, easier to learn pieces, makes them possible to learn. I will be able to use this skill in many places.</p>

    <p>The games and visualizations course taught me how to create and manipulate objects. Object-oriented programing is used everywhere and it makes many of the things we use easier/possible to code. After doing this module, I understood the basics of object-oriented programming. When I code a game I’ll be using object-oriented programing to make things more efficient.

    <p> AP computer science really opened up the world of computer science outside of just regular programming. Computer science is a part of our daily lives and because of that, it is such a large field, much more than just coding. It furthered my understanding of computer science and problem-solving.</p>

    <div id="dark">
    <p>Freecodecamp was very useful for learning HTML and CSS. Everything was broken down into very small lessons. By seeing this format I am able to break down other problems I face in the same way that freecodecamp did. Using this I can solve problems and learn independently which is a skill that is very beneficial for both coding and non-coding purposes.</p>

    <p>Cubing, helped me understand algorithms and problem-solving. In a way cubing can represent the building blocks of understanding code. You need to be able to solve problems, understand algorithms, be able to teach yourself, be able to communicate with a team and teach others, and cubing teaches us all that.</p>
